Homeowner bugs:
  - [FIXED - TEMPORARY] Owners cannot see any properties 
  - [FIXED - TEMPORARY] Owners cannot see any requests
  - [FIXED - TEMPORARY] Owners see all requests instead of just their own

Critical security issues:
  - RLS (Row Level Security) policies were temporarily disabled on job_requests and quotes tables
  - This means no access control at the database level - any authenticated user can see all records
  - Need to rebuild proper RLS policies that don't cause infinite recursion
  - Current temporary fix allows the app to work but with compromised security

To fix RLS recursion:
  - Keep the modified useJobs.ts that fetches data in separate queries
  - Create non-recursive RLS policies that use direct ID comparisons
  - Avoid complex nested EXISTS queries in RLS policies
  - Apply policies one by one to identify which ones cause recursion
  - Test each policy with specific queries to ensure proper access control
